Our team of scientists, technologists, and academics looks beyond traditional methods to develop creative solutions to some of the world’s most complex economic problems.

We are seeking a data scientist to join our growing team and contribute to developing real-time views of consumer and sector-level microeconomic behavior and insights into how that collective behavior manifests in the global economy. We use large-scale real-world observational data to observe and contextualize macroeconomic conditions, regional economic health, consumer decision making, and sector- and firm-level performance in order to drive investment strategies. We often work with semi- or unstructured data sets, and need to be comfortable getting deep into messy data to design, test, and implement economically-intuitive features that measure real world economic activity. To accomplish this, we work closely with our partners to identify, develop, and monetize differentiated hypothesis-driven features that provide a real-time lens on emerging economic and commercial trends.
You are excited to take on the following opportunities:
Get into the weeds of large-scale real-world observational data to infer and control for potential biases resulting from complex data generating processes
Continually develop subject-matter expertise by engaging with internal and external partners to learn how various industries interact with suppliers, serve their customers, and assess their internal financial performance
Independently generate, articulate, and implement hypotheses on what may affect US and international industry- or firm-level performance trends
Develop a deep understanding of the application of empirical methods and data science to challenging applied prediction problems
You should possess the following qualifications:
Degree in a technical or quantitative discipline, like chemistry, computer science, economics, statistics, or quantitative social science with an applied empirical focus (all levels welcome, from bachelor’s to doctorate)
Proficient in Python and SQL
Performed an in-depth research project, examining real-world data
Are an independent thinker who can creatively approach data analysis and communicate complex ideas clearly
You don’t need a background in finance. It’s nice to have, but more than half of Two Sigma’s employees come from outside the finance industry. If you’ve got the research skills, we can teach you the financial aspects of the job.
You will enjoy the following benefits:
Core Benefits: Fully paid medical and dental insurance premiums for employees and dependents, competitive 401k match, employer-paid life & disability insurance
Perks: Onsite gyms with laundry service, wellness activities, casual dress, snacks, game rooms
Learning: Tuition reimbursement, conference and training sponsorship
Time Off: Generous vacation and unlimited sick days, competitive paid caregiver leaves

Ultimately, the team’s work strengthens Etsy and helps continuously improve the Etsy experience.

Learning new skills and techniques is not only a requirement but a perk of the job. We are always looking for opportunities to improve. Our mission is to demystify marketing with insights grounded in data, telling the story of how we attract and retain our users to teams, to senior management, and to the community.

Transform raw data into meaningful and impactful analysis characterized by strong data governance, technique clarity, and clear documentation

Identify key metrics that drive the performance of marketing channels and marketing products, make these accessible to partners through dashboards and reports, and drive these metrics through statistical analyses of experiments

Continually evaluate and refine your technical toolkit, sharing what you learn with the team



Qualifications

About You
Ideally, you'll bring:

2-3 years of proven experience as a data scientist/analyst or in a quantitative role in which you extracted meaning from big data sets with little engineering support

Proficient in SQL and either R or Python. Bonus points for experience with the Hadoop ecosystem or additional scripting languages (Scala, PHP, Ruby, etc.)

Proven ability to communicate your insights verbally, visually, and in writing with teammates and business partners

Comfortable guiding others, recommending tools and standard methodologies to improve the efficiency of the teams work

Strong, independent, analytical problem solver who enjoys thinking about and solving complex and nuanced problems

Passionate about subjects such as experimental design, data visualization, and statistical analysis techniques

Experience with Looker, Tableau, or other data visualization software a plus

Ultimately, the team’s work strengthens Etsy and helps continuously improve the Etsy experience.

Learning new skills and techniques is not only a requirement but a perk of the job. We are always looking for opportunities to improve. Our mission is to demystify marketing with insights grounded in data, telling the story of how we attract and retain our users to teams, to senior management, and to the community.

Transform raw data into meaningful and impactful analysis characterized by strong data governance, technique clarity, and clear documentation

Identify key metrics that drive the performance of marketing channels and marketing products, make these accessible to partners through dashboards and reports, and drive these metrics through statistical analyses of experiments

Continually evaluate and refine your technical toolkit, sharing what you learn with the team



Qualifications

About You
Ideally, you'll bring:

2-3 years of proven experience as a data scientist/analyst or in a quantitative role in which you extracted meaning from big data sets with little engineering support

Experience with acquisition and retention marketing operations, channel attribution, churn and lifetime value models, analytical tools and infrastructure, and finding efficient growth strategies a plus

Proficient in SQL and either R or Python. Bonus points for experience with the Hadoop ecosystem or additional scripting languages (Scala, PHP, Ruby, etc.)

Proven ability to communicate your insights verbally, visually, and in writing with teammates and business partners

Comfortable guiding others, recommending tools and standard methodologies to improve the efficiency of the teams work

Strong, independent, analytical problem solver who enjoys thinking about and solving complex and nuanced problems

Passionate about subjects such as experimental design, data visualization, and statistical analysis techniques

Experience with Looker, Tableau, or other data visualization software a plus

Ultimately, the team’s work strengthens Etsy and helps continuously improve the Etsy experience.

Learning new skills and techniques is not only a requirement but a perk of the job. We are always looking for opportunities to improve. Our mission is to demystify marketing with insights grounded in data, telling the story of how we attract and retain our users to teams, to senior management, and to the community.

Transform raw data into meaningful and impactful analysis characterized by strong data governance, technique clarity, and clear documentation

Identify key metrics that drive the performance of marketing channels and marketing products, make these accessible to partners through dashboards and reports, and drive these metrics through statistical analyses of experiments

Continually evaluate and refine your technical toolkit, sharing what you learn with the team



Qualifications

About You
Ideally, you'll bring:

2-3 years of proven experience as a data scientist/analyst or in a quantitative role in which you extracted meaning from big data sets with little engineering support

Experience with acquisition and retention marketing operations, channel attribution, churn and lifetime value models, analytical tools and infrastructure, and finding efficient growth strategies a plus

Proficient in SQL and either R or Python. Bonus points for experience with the Hadoop ecosystem or additional scripting languages (Scala, PHP, Ruby, etc.)

Proven ability to communicate your insights verbally, visually, and in writing with teammates and business partners

Comfortable guiding others, recommending tools and standard methodologies to improve the efficiency of the teams work

Strong, independent, analytical problem solver who enjoys thinking about and solving complex and nuanced problems

Passionate about subjects such as experimental design, data visualization, and statistical analysis techniques

Experience with Looker, Tableau, or other data visualization software a plus

Job Description

Ultimately, the team’s work strengthens Etsy and helps continuously improve the Etsy experience.

Learning new skills and techniques is not only a requirement but a perk of the job. We are always looking for opportunities to improve. Our mission is to demystify marketing with insights grounded in data, telling the story of how we attract and retain our users to teams, to senior management, and to the community.

Transform raw data into meaningful and impactful analysis characterized by strong data governance, technique clarity, and clear documentation

Identify key metrics that drive the performance of marketing channels and marketing products, make these accessible to partners through dashboards and reports, and drive these metrics through statistical analyses of experiments

Continually evaluate and refine your technical toolkit, sharing what you learn with the team



Qualifications

About You
Ideally, you'll bring:

2-3 years of proven experience as a data scientist/analyst or in a quantitative role in which you extracted meaning from big data sets with little engineering support

Experience with acquisition and retention marketing operations, channel attribution, churn and lifetime value models, analytical tools and infrastructure, and finding efficient growth strategies a plus

Proficient in SQL and either R or Python. Bonus points for experience with the Hadoop ecosystem or additional scripting languages (Scala, PHP, Ruby, etc.)

Proven ability to communicate your insights verbally, visually, and in writing with teammates and business partners

Comfortable guiding others, recommending tools and standard methodologies to improve the efficiency of the teams work

Strong, independent, analytical problem solver who enjoys thinking about and solving complex and nuanced problems

Passionate about subjects such as experimental design, data visualization, and statistical analysis techniques

Experience with Looker, Tableau, or other data visualization software a plus

Sidewalk Labs is an urban innovation company that tackles cities' greatest challenges. We create products and solutions, invest in new companies, and help developers build more sustainable, innovative, and equitable places around the world. Our ambitious vision requires us to push ourselves beyond conventional thinking, and we work hard in pursuit of our mission. Our cross-disciplinary team consists of experts from real estate, urban planning, government, finance, technology, and engineering, among other backgrounds.

Our urban innovations include Delve (a generative design product that empowers real estate teams to design better, faster, with less risk), Mesa (an easy-install kit for commercial buildings that cuts energy costs, improves tenant comfort, and simplifies building operations), Pebble (a low-cost vehicle sensor to help manage parking and curb space), and Affordable Electrification (a new way to manage home energy use to meet a customer's monthly budget). We're also developing an offsite construction company that can deliver high-quality mass timber buildings for more sustainable living and working.

With the potential to radically improve quality of life in cities for all, our work is both exciting and complex. We are working to achieve something unprecedented — help us build it!

What is the role?

Your role is to craft the control algorithms by which energy use in every home in America will be optimized for cost, comfort and local demand management.

Your models will involve numerous variables, including a dynamically changing price of power, unique comfort preferences per user (that must be learned), and a wide breadth of equipment to control in concert - some of which may have onboard control sequences that must be considered. Further, you must avoid every device in a home or neighborhood responding equivalently to the same cues and thereby creating a new inrush or spike in demand.

Your role is to figure out the priority and sequence of operations in a home to shift and shave load in order to meet a budget.

You will report to the Senior Product Manager on the team and work closely with the engineering team.

What you have to achieve:

In your first 3 months, you will have:

Developed strong relationships within the team and learn each member's role, skill set, and unique background.
A firm understanding of the product vision and what we have learned to date.
Become familiar with the available datasets and ML algorithms developed so far.
Analyzed home energy data to identify usage patterns and develop personas.
Setup necessary data processing pipelines to develop models that predict energy usage using weather, historical consumption data.

In your first 6 months, you will have:

Collaboratively worked with the engineering team to arrive at device control strategies that optimize for multiple objectives.
Developed and be actively refining the predictive and prescriptive models in use. These include predicting energy consumption and providing device operating schedules.
Identified learnings and insights to communicate with internal and external stakeholders, and worked with the engineering team to develop reports, dashboards and visualizations.
What we expect:

Know your data science.

You have in-depth experience with statistics and machine learning.
You demonstrate excellent analytical and modeling abilities (linear models, multivariate analysis, stochastic models, sampling methods).
You have experience implementing end-to-end data processing pipelines and developing algorithms.
Bonus: You are passionate about energy, and endlessly seeking better ways to manage it in homes and buildings. You are familiar with HVAC, occupancy, temperature, lighting and plug load data and how to analyze it.

Be a technologist.

You are able to write code to work with large datasets and across all stages, including extraction, cleaning/validation, analysis and interpretation.
Experience with Python is a plus.
Be comfortable with a range of open source tools and frameworks, and make good decisions about which to use to solve a problem. You are excited to learn something new when the need arises.
Be creative: you'll come up with new ideas based on your broad understanding of technological possibilities and city domain knowledge.

Solve problems, together.

You work well in cross functional teams. You are adept at communicating your ideas, responsive to new information, and value the input and ideas of technologists and non technologists alike.
You ask hard questions and challenge assumptions to ensure that we're solving the right problems.
You are flexible to working on the team's most important problems.
You relish in the differences between people and how to develop products that work for everyone. You are passionate about making sustainability inclusive and equitable.

We are very excited to hear from you.

Our urban innovations include Delve (a generative design product that empowers real estate teams to design better, faster, with less risk), Mesa (an easy-install kit for commercial buildings that cuts energy costs, improves tenant comfort, and simplifies building operations), Pebble (a low-cost vehicle sensor to help manage parking and curb space), and Affordable Electrification (a new way to manage home energy use to meet a customer's monthly budget). We're also developing an offsite construction company that can deliver high-quality mass timber buildings for more sustainable living and working.

With the potential to radically improve quality of life in cities for all, our work is both exciting and complex. We are working to achieve something unprecedented — help us build it!

What is the role?

Your role is to craft the control algorithms by which energy use in every home in America will be optimized for cost, comfort and local demand management.

Your models will involve numerous variables, including a dynamically changing price of power, unique comfort preferences per user (that must be learned), and a wide breadth of equipment to control in concert - some of which may have onboard control sequences that must be considered. Further, you must avoid every device in a home or neighborhood responding equivalently to the same cues and thereby creating a new inrush or spike in demand.

Your role is to figure out the priority and sequence of operations in a home to shift and shave load in order to meet a budget.

You will report to the Senior Product Manager on the team and work closely with the engineering team.

What you have to achieve:

In your first 3 months, you will have:

Developed strong relationships within the team and learn each member's role, skill set, and unique background.
A firm understanding of the product vision and what we have learned to date.
Become familiar with the available datasets and ML algorithms developed so far.
Analyzed home energy data to identify usage patterns and develop personas.
Setup necessary data processing pipelines to develop models that predict energy usage using weather, historical consumption data.

In your first 6 months, you will have:

Collaboratively worked with the engineering team to arrive at device control strategies that optimize for multiple objectives.
Developed and be actively refining the predictive and prescriptive models in use. These include predicting energy consumption and providing device operating schedules.
Identified learnings and insights to communicate with internal and external stakeholders, and worked with the engineering team to develop reports, dashboards and visualizations.
What we expect:

Know your data science.

You have in-depth experience with statistics and machine learning.
You demonstrate excellent analytical and modeling abilities (linear models, multivariate analysis, stochastic models, sampling methods).
You have experience implementing end-to-end data processing pipelines and developing algorithms.
Bonus: You are passionate about energy, and endlessly seeking better ways to manage it in homes and buildings. You are familiar with HVAC, occupancy, temperature, lighting and plug load data and how to analyze it.

Be a technologist.

You are able to write code to work with large datasets and across all stages, including extraction, cleaning/validation, analysis and interpretation.
Experience with Python is a plus.
Be comfortable with a range of open source tools and frameworks, and make good decisions about which to use to solve a problem. You are excited to learn something new when the need arises.
Be creative: you'll come up with new ideas based on your broad understanding of technological possibilities and city domain knowledge.

Solve problems, together.

You work well in cross functional teams. You are adept at communicating your ideas, responsive to new information, and value the input and ideas of technologists and non technologists alike.
You ask hard questions and challenge assumptions to ensure that we're solving the right problems.
You are flexible to working on the team's most important problems.
You relish in the differences between people and how to develop products that work for everyone. You are passionate about making sustainability inclusive and equitable.

Our urban innovations include Delve (a generative design product that empowers real estate teams to design better, faster, with less risk), Mesa (an easy-install kit for commercial buildings that cuts energy costs, improves tenant comfort, and simplifies building operations), Pebble (a low-cost vehicle sensor to help manage parking and curb space), and Affordable Electrification (a new way to manage home energy use to meet a customer's monthly budget). We're also developing an offsite construction company that can deliver high-quality mass timber buildings for more sustainable living and working.

With the potential to radically improve quality of life in cities for all, our work is both exciting and complex. We are working to achieve something unprecedented — help us build it!

What is the role?

Your role is to craft the control algorithms by which energy use in every home in America will be optimized for cost, comfort and local demand management.

Your models will involve numerous variables, including a dynamically changing price of power, unique comfort preferences per user (that must be learned), and a wide breadth of equipment to control in concert - some of which may have onboard control sequences that must be considered. Further, you must avoid every device in a home or neighborhood responding equivalently to the same cues and thereby creating a new inrush or spike in demand.

Your role is to figure out the priority and sequence of operations in a home to shift and shave load in order to meet a budget.

You will report to the Senior Product Manager on the team and work closely with the engineering team.

What you have to achieve:

In your first 3 months, you will have:

Developed strong relationships within the team and learn each member's role, skill set, and unique background.
A firm understanding of the product vision and what we have learned to date.
Become familiar with the available datasets and ML algorithms developed so far.
Analyzed home energy data to identify usage patterns and develop personas.
Setup necessary data processing pipelines to develop models that predict energy usage using weather, historical consumption data.

In your first 6 months, you will have:

Collaboratively worked with the engineering team to arrive at device control strategies that optimize for multiple objectives.
Developed and be actively refining the predictive and prescriptive models in use. These include predicting energy consumption and providing device operating schedules.
Identified learnings and insights to communicate with internal and external stakeholders, and worked with the engineering team to develop reports, dashboards and visualizations.
What we expect:

Know your data science.

You have in-depth experience with statistics and machine learning.
You demonstrate excellent analytical and modeling abilities (linear models, multivariate analysis, stochastic models, sampling methods).
You have experience implementing end-to-end data processing pipelines and developing algorithms.
Bonus: You are passionate about energy, and endlessly seeking better ways to manage it in homes and buildings. You are familiar with HVAC, occupancy, temperature, lighting and plug load data and how to analyze it.

Be a technologist.

You are able to write code to work with large datasets and across all stages, including extraction, cleaning/validation, analysis and interpretation.
Experience with Python is a plus.
Be comfortable with a range of open source tools and frameworks, and make good decisions about which to use to solve a problem. You are excited to learn something new when the need arises.
Be creative: you'll come up with new ideas based on your broad understanding of technological possibilities and city domain knowledge.

Solve problems, together.

You work well in cross functional teams. You are adept at communicating your ideas, responsive to new information, and value the input and ideas of technologists and non technologists alike.
You ask hard questions and challenge assumptions to ensure that we're solving the right problems.
You are flexible to working on the team's most important problems.
You relish in the differences between people and how to develop products that work for everyone. You are passionate about making sustainability inclusive and equitable.
