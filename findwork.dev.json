Together, we will enhance our cloud-based data platform to get the right info, infer useful things and make better decisions. Then test, and keep improving. In areas where the data platform is already fully functional, you’ll lend your sharp logic to improve internal processes, automate systems, and optimise, well, everything. And down the track, we’d love you to get involved with some Bayesian analysis, machine learning and other interesting data-related projects.<br><br></div><div>At some companies, we observe a familiar pattern: the most technically excellent developers hit a ceiling beyond which they can’t progress unless they start taking on direct “reports”, and becoming “managers”. Given no other options to progress their careers, they launch themselves down this path. As they progress they spend less and less time doing the thing that they love (crafting excellent code and data flows) while they learn a completely different craft — management — and spend more and more time caring for their people and their success. At Bellroy we love the people who want to make that transition, (and the current manager started here as a data engineer) but we don’t think that it should be the only path to career progression, and we make sure that we have a technical stream that allows people to keep getting better at engineering. This is a role (starting) in that technical stream (which doesn’t mean that you can’t hop streams later).<br><br></div><div>If you get excited by the idea of providing the right data to inform great decisions; and you want that data to be accessible, understandable and trustworthy, then this could be the job for you.
