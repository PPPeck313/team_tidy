 2) You are responsible for writing production models to enhance the main product, e.g recommendation systems for e-commerce 
 3)  You are the product  - without machine learning, it wouldn't exist 
 The Data Science team built the product at Tessian. We couldn't exist without our machine learning models; it&rsquo;s at the heart of what we do, and it&rsquo;s what our clients rely on day-to-day. We're searching for a Lead NLP Data Scientist who is excited about the opportunities and challenges that come with researching, building and deploying real-time production models. In this role you'll get to: 
 
 Work across massive enterprise email datasets 
 Defining and driving roadmap for technical excellence in Data Science at Tessian 
 Deploy models to production that impacts directly our customers and products 
 Improve our ML workflow 
 Collaborate with engineering and product leaders to develop a product suite that is continually detecting more advanced threats for our customers 
 Make your mark on leading ambitious projects 
 Mentor and knowledge share with data scientists at Tessian
